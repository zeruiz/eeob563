Wow, you made it really difficult to critique this project.
I like how concise your intro is and stil puts the point across.
One thing you missed is that the intstructions mentioned double spaced. I don't think you'd get points docked for it but just pointing it out, so if you like, you can change it!
I don't think you need to explain your method in results. Results should be straight up data. You could put that in discussion.
You progess from simpler to stricter methods in terms of analyses, which is great, but I'm almost thinking that you may not need of the methods such Maximum Parsimony when you have Neighbor Joining. This is just a thought . What you have done also flows really well though.
I'm sorry, that's all I got. I know this is not much input, but you have really done a great job !
